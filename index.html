                  Decorating the inside of your home can be both daunting and exciting so let your imagination run wild.
                  The first place to start when it comes to decorating your home is to draw inspiration from a range of sources.  Get inspired for your dream interior, by watching home decorating shows, and browsing magazines, interior design websites and images online. Pinterest is a great place to find a wealth of inspiring images and tips. <br>
                  Plan for success do not make the mistake of purchasing items or painting your walls without a plan in the first place.<br>
                  The three most important concepts to consider for each room are the theme, colour scheme, and lighting mood.
                  Knowing what you want to achieve for each room will help create a harmonious end result. Buying things randomly can end up creating a miss matched and poor aesthetic.
                  To prevent impulse or regretful purchases, take photos of your room and look at it while shopping to help you visualise how things would look.<br>
                  It is also a smart idea to take photos of items you see when shopping to think about overnight before making your decision to purchase, if you struggle to visualise interior design changes when your house is already cluttered, put your belongings away storage them somewhere before you take photos of your rooms, it is always much easier working from a clean slate.
